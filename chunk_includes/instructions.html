	<h3><b>Instructions:</b></h3>

<p>
    In this experiment you will be presented with prompts consisting of partial sentences and your task is to complete these sentences. When completing the sentence, you have to first re-type the prompt and then complete the sentence. 
</p>

<p>
    For example, consider the following prompt: "My brother was happy that"
</p>

<p>
    <b> Correct form of completing the prompt: </b> My brother was happy that it was sunny outside. <br>

    <b> Incorrect form of completing the prompt: </b> it was sunny outside. 
</p>

<p>
    Once you finish typing the entire sentence, you will click on the "next prompt" button to move on to the next sentence. The sentences you write should be grammatical, but you do not have to spend too much time coming up with plausible scenarios. For example when given a prompt like "The pirate who was drowning", it is perfectly okay to generate a sentence like "The pirate who was drowning really liked chocolate cake".

</p>

<p>
     <b> Remember: you cannot progress to the next sentence unless you type both the prompt and your completion together as a single sentence.<b>
</p>
